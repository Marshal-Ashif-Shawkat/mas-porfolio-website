I am a human. People call me Marshal. It is Marshal Ashif Shawkat on my certificate. I want to become a genetic engineer in the future. I love open-source software and technology. Despite being overweight, I fail to push myself to do exercise.  
Currently, I am pursuing B.Sc. in biomedical engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.  
In my leisure time, I watch youtube, movies and read books. Of course, I waste time on social media.
I dream of leaving a better world when I am dead.
