I am a human. People call me Marshal. It is Marshal Ashif Shawkat on my certificate. I want to teach machines how to think. I love open-source software and technology. Despite being overweight, I fail to push myself to do exercise.   

Currently, I am pursuing B.Sc. in biomedical engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.   

In my leisure time, I watch youtube, movies and read books. Of course, I waste time on social media.   

I dream of leaving a better world for future generations. But what does it mean by the word "better"? What are the fundamental characteristics of a better world? How do we find those variables and measure them to get a meaningful picture about the progress of human race?
